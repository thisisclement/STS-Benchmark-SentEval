## STS Benchmark Evaluator 
STS Benchmark Evaluator is a helper library that evaluates Sentence Transformer models for Semantic Textual Similarity Tasks. 

This utilises the STS-Benchmark test set for the evaluation.

## Further work
- Increase test scope to STS-Benchmark dev set
- Increase test scope to other STS related evaluation (depending on need)
